Static Website CI/CD Pipeline with AWS
This repository contains the source code for a static website and the full infrastructure-as-code (IaC) for a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS. The pipeline automates the process of building and deploying the website from a GitHub push, ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow.

Key Technologies:
GitHub: Source code repository and trigger for the CI/CD pipeline.

AWS CodePipeline: Orchestrates the end-to-end delivery process, from source to deployment.

AWS CodeBuild: Compiles the source code and packages it into a deployable artifact.

Amazon S3: Used for storing both build artifacts and hosting the static website.

k6: An open-source load testing tool integrated into the build process to verify application performance.

Architecture and Workflow
The CI/CD pipeline is designed to be fully automated and event-driven.

Source: A code push to the main branch of this GitHub repository triggers the CodePipeline.

Build: CodePipeline initiates an AWS CodeBuild project. CodeBuild executes the instructions in the buildspec.yml file to prepare the application for deployment.

Deploy: The final artifact from CodeBuild is deployed by CodePipeline to an Amazon S3 bucket, which is configured for static website hosting.

The Build Specification (buildspec.yml)
The buildspec.yml file is the heart of the build process. It performs the following critical steps:

Phase: pre_build
This phase is used for setting up the environment.

Phase: build

Find and Copy Files: Recursively finds all website files from the source directory, regardless of their case, and copies them to an output directory.

Integrate k6 Performance Test: This is a crucial step for quality assurance. The build process runs a k6 script to verify that the website's main endpoint returns a 200 OK status code within an acceptable response time. This ensures the deployed website is immediately available and responsive.

Phase: post_build

Package Artifact: The contents of the output directory are packaged into a single .zip file, which serves as the final build artifact. This artifact is then made available for the deployment stage.

Deployment Details
The pipeline uses two dedicated S3 buckets:

Artifact Bucket: A private S3 bucket (s3://your-artifact-bucket-name/) is used to securely store the zipped artifact generated by CodeBuild. It is not publicly accessible.

Website Hosting Bucket: A separate, public S3 bucket (s3://your-website-hosting-bucket-name/) is configured to host the static website. CodePipeline takes the artifact from the first bucket and deploys its contents directly into this bucket.

Current Status and Next Steps
The CodeBuild step is currently encountering a failure. I am actively troubleshooting the issue, focusing on the file pathing and permissions within the buildspec.yml script. The integration of k6 for automated testing is a key part of this process, and getting it to execute successfully is the immediate priority to ensure robust and reliable deployments moving forward.

Future Enhancements
Advanced k6 Tests: Expand the k6 test suite to include more detailed performance metrics, such as latency, throughput, and error rate, on multiple pages.

Slack/Email Notifications: Add a stage to the CodePipeline to send automated notifications to a Slack channel or email list on success or failure, enabling real-time monitoring.

Rollback Functionality: Implement a rollback stage in the pipeline to automatically revert to the previous successful version in case of a failed deployment.:WQ
